# ðŸŒŸ Beginner Practice with Dictionary and Set in Python

This is my small Python practice using Dictionary and Set.  
I wrote this code after watching Apna College's video (Shraddha Didi) on this topic.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
- Creating a dictionary to store subject marks
- Accessing values using keys
- Using a set to store names
- Understanding how sets remove duplicates

## ðŸŽ¯ Output:
- It prints a subject-wise mark from the dictionary
- It shows a set of unique friend names

  # Dictionary Example
marks = {
    "Math": 90,
    "Science": 85,
    "English": 92
}

print("Marks Dictionary:")
print(marks)
print("Marks in Math:", marks["Math"])

# Set Example
friends = {"Amit", "Neha", "Riya", "Neha"}

print("\nFriends Set:")
print(friends)  # Duplicate 'Neha' will be removed
